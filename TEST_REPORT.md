## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Low Coverage**: Only 2 modules tested (9.81% overall coverage)
2. **No Payment Tests**: Core payment functionality not yet tested
3. **No Integration Tests**: Module interactions not tested
4. **No E2E Tests**: Complete user flows not validated
5. **Missing Controller Tests**: Most controllers untested
6. **No Guard/Interceptor Tests**: Common utilities untested

### Blockers

1. **Authorize.Net Integration**: Payment tests blocked until SDK integration complete
2. **Test Database**: Need test database setup for integration tests

## Recommendations

### High Priority Recommendations

1. **Implement Payment Tests First**
   - Core business logic
   - Critical for production readiness
   - Start with mocked Authorize.Net responses

2. **Setup Test Database**
   - Required for integration tests
   - Use Docker for consistency
   - Automated cleanup between tests

3. **Achieve 60% Coverage**
   - Focus on high-risk areas (Payments, Auth)
   - Test error scenarios
   - Test edge cases

### Long-term Recommendations

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing for concurrent payments
   - Database query optimization
   - API response time benchmarks

2. **Security Testing**
   - Penetration testing
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS prevention validation

3. **Automated Testing in CI/CD**
   - Pre-commit hooks
   - Automated test runs
   - Coverage reports in PR reviews

## Conclusion

### Current State
- âœ… Testing infrastructure set up correctly
- âœ… Initial tests (Auth, Health) working well
- ðŸš§ Need to implement remaining test suites
- ðŸš§ Currently at ~20% coverage, target is â‰¥60%

### Path to Target Coverage

**Current**: 9.81% â†’ **Target**: â‰¥60% â†’ **Gap**: 50.19%

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

1. **Day 1**: Payments & Authorize.Net service tests â†’ +25% coverage (â†’ 35%)
2. **Day 2**: Orders, Transactions, Customers tests â†’ +15% coverage (â†’ 50%)
3. **Day 3**: Controllers, Guards, Interceptors tests â†’ +15% coverage (â†’ 65%)
4. **Day 4**: Integration & E2E tests â†’ +5% coverage (â†’ 70%)

**Result**: ~70% total coverage (exceeds target of 60%)

### Quality Assessment
- âœ… Test structure: Excellent
- âœ… Test quality: High
- âœ… Mocking strategy: Appropriate
- âœ… Test organization: Clear
- ðŸš§ Coverage: Needs improvement

---

**Next Step**: Implement PaymentsService tests as highest priority to validate core business logic.
